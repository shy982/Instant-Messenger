# Instant-Messenger
This project uses Java, JDBC and MySQL to simulate a real time instant messaging application key features being Space efficient, User friendly interface and Facilitation of both formal and informal modes of communication.

Instant messaging (IM) is a form of text-based communication in which two people participate in a single conversation over their computers or mobile devices. Our Project titled "Instant Messenger" is a service that allows two users to communicate via a chat/messaging interface. It represents a media via which messaging partners can interact in a synchronous fashion. With Instant Messenger we aim to provide an easy to use and a rich graphical user interface. The software establishes a direct connection between users so they can talk to each other simultaneously, in real time if connected over a LAN. Our Project uses fundamental Database Management concepts along with Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) and the front end is implemented through Java itself.
